# Various texts about PC maintenance

This repository started with a manual about PC reinstallation,
focusing on making dual-booting Windows and Linux as intertwined as possible.

Other texts followed as I continued with the hardening of my dual-booting setup.
Now you can read how to customize Windows by removing some irritating default
settings, or how to unify working environment across operating systems, and
various terminal emulators.
